# Docker Compose Practice – Amazon Clone

This project is created to *practice Docker Compose*.
I already built an *Amazon Clone website using HTML and CSS*.
In this project, I wrote a *basic docker-compose.yml* file to run the website
inside an *Nginx container*.

The website is deployed on *AWS EC2* by opening the required port
and accessing it through the Docker container.

Purpose of this project is to *learn and practice Docker Compose basics.
